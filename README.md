# Genesis Template

A robust full-stack template featuring a modern stack with Vite, React, and Express. This template is designed for rapid development with a focus on scalability, best practices, and a well-organized folder structure.

## ðŸš€ Install

Prerequisites: Node.js, NPM, degit (`npm install -g degit`)

Run this command in the folder you want to install template to
```bash
degit torstendngh/genesis .
```

> [!NOTE]  
> You may notice ".gitkeep" files in empty folders. They exist to force git from cloning the empty folders, to keep the folder structure intact. You can install this template withouth the ".gitkeep" files below

## ðŸš€ Install and remove .gitkeep files

The default install method (above) keeps the ".gitkeep" files so the folder structure stays in tact. If you want to remove these files on clone, run this command instead.

Prerequisites: Node.js, NPM, degit (`npm install -g degit`)

Run this command in the folder you want to install template to
```bash
degit torstendngh/genesis . && find . -name ".gitkeep" -delete
```

The command works as follows:

1. `degit torstendngh/genesis .`: Clones the genesis template repository from torstendngh into the current directory without including the .git folder.

2. `find . -name ".gitkeep" -delete`: Searches for all .gitkeep files within the current directory and deletes them.

This approach ensures that the necessary files and folders from the template are copied over, while cleaning up placeholder ".gitkeep" files used to track otherwise empty folders.
